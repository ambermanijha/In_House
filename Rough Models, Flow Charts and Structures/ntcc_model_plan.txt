1. Data management (healthy, unhealthy)/stages
	a. IF data is unlabelled:
		i.  Cluster or classify data (method out of these two depends on dataset)
		ii. Give labelled data to next step.
	b. IF labelled:
		I. continue.

2. Build a GAN which is *not* a classifying GAN.

3. build separate instances and train them and save them for all classes depending on how many were given by step 1.

4.use saved and trained GANS to give outputs which should be saved in a separate folder for each class(separate GANs now) which will all be inside the output folder.

5.Build website which allows the user to access the output folder.
